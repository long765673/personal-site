## Introduction

With the current situation of Covid, having an online presence for has never been so important. Most people will rely on Facebook pages to stablish an online presence, without thinking that they are building it in a walled garden. Having a domain name and a site under that domain linking to other social networks is a better way to go when creating online authority for your name, business, or brand. In this tutorial, I will teach you how easy it is to create a simple website or blog for your personal CV or brand completely free using GitHub as a hosting provider and code repository. This tutorial will be intended for Windows users but the steps should be similar in Linux and Mac OS users. In order to get this done, you will need:

* Windows computer and internet connection

```
- Why its important to have website (normal)
- Why right know its even more important to have online presence
- How easy and cheap is for anyone to do
- We will be building a static site on GitHub, for free, etc
```

## Static sites

In order to be able to run our site for free, it has to be a static site, a static site as the name implies, is a site that never changes, every user visiting the site will see the same pages, in contrast with a dynamic site, that for example users could login and have some customized data displayed to them, dynamic sites require a backed server to process and render the data specifically to the user while static does not, making it very "cheap" to run, so much, that services like GitHub allows you to do it for free.

If you already have some HTML and CSS coding experience you could create your own static site your self without needing any static site generator tool. The advantage of choosing one is that it reduces significantly the amount of coding knowledge you need to almost nothing, you only need to understand how to edit text and configuration files.

For this guide we have chosen Hugo.

### Hugo - A static site generator

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is modern and very popular static site generator written in the Go language ([Golang](https://golang.org/)) which also happens to be Open Source and free to use. It has a big community and a huge variety of themes to chose from. We will go in detail what we mean by "themes" in the next sections.

### Using themes

Now that you understand a bit more of how to create and run a very simple static site with Hugo, lets spice things up, if we wanted we could create our own site in Hugo from scratch, this will require to know some HTML, CSS, templating and some of the internals fo Hugo to create our own 100% customized site. But there is a easier option, as mentioned before, Hugo has a big community and they offer a huge variety of prebuilt sites, these are called themes. You can navigate the themes here: <https://themes.gohugo.io/>

Find one you like for your site, depending on the purpose of it, you may chose from, a personal site, a blog, or something else.

For this guide we will be using [Ananke](https://themes.gohugo.io/gohugo-theme-ananke/) theme.

### Running Hugo on Windows

Lets first install Hugo and get familiar creating a basic site and making local modifications by using Windows PowerShell.

For these guide we recommend using Chocolatey, a package manager for Windows to install the prerequisites.\
Follow this guide to install Chocolatey if you don't have already: <https://chocolatey.org/install>

After having Chocolatey installed, open a PowerShell terminal and run the following commands:

`choco install hugo -confirm`

Hugo as we said is the static site generator, and we will be using it to run our site locally in our computers.

`choco install github-desktop`

GitHub desktop will simply the process of uploading (pushing) source code to GitHub.

Great! Now you have Git and Hugo installed on your machine.

### Create new Hugo site

In the same PowerShell, navigate to your home directory with the following command `cd $HOME/Documents`

![powershell_home.png](powershell_home.png?fileId=323046#mimetype=image%2Fpng&hasPreview=true)

Next, we will tell Hugo to create a new site, choose a name for it, something like `personal-site`

`hugo new site <sitename>`

After running this command, Hugo will create a folder with the same name and with multiple files in side, navigate to that directory with: `cd <sitename>` if you list the files inside using `ls`, it should look something like:

![powershell_personal-site.png](powershell_personal-site.png?fileId=323059#mimetype=image%2Fpng&hasPreview=true)

Now we need to initialize this new project as a Git repository:

`git init`

Import the theme you choose in the previous section:

`git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke`

Next open the `config.toml` on the root of the folder and specify some parameters for this Hugo site, a toml is a text file, so you can use Notepad, VSCode or any other editor you prefer.

We are going to modify the title and then a new parameter called `theme` with the name of the theme we choose. Your file should look like this:

```
baseURL = "http://example.org/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "My New Hugo Site"
theme = "ananke"
```

Save the file when you are done.

Next, run your new site locally with the selected theme:

`hugo server --watch`

The command above should output something similar to this:

```
hugo server --watch
Start building sites â€¦

                   | EN

Running in Fast Render Mode. For full rebuilds on change: hugo server --disableFastRender
Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

You now can visit the following url on your browser and see your new siteðŸ’¥:

http://localhost:1313

### Making changes and adding content

If everything went well, you should see a very basic page with the title of the site.

In this section we will go on to explaining how to customize this site further and add more pages and posts.

Every Hugo theme has a set of basic features and other have more specific customization you can do, since we want you to be able to chose any other theme, we will guide through the most common features so that you can apply this knowledge in other themes and sites you build in the future.

First of all, we need to make a distinction between 2 concepts, in Hugo you have **Pages** and **Posts**, a Page is a static section in you site that doesn't change too often, maybe the about us, the history of your organization, or the contact page, and then you have posts which are articles that you write in a more frequent basis and are ordered by publish date.

Lets add our first page, it is going to be the About me. Create a new folder inside the `content`

directory named `about-me` and then create a file named `_index.md` inside.

Add the following content to it:

```
---
title: "About Me"
date: 2021-03-27
draft: false
---

Write something about you here
```

Next we will add a post, a post can be added by create a new file under `content/posts`.

Create a file named `my-first-post.md` under `content/posts` with the following content:

```
---
title: "My First Post"
date: 2021-03-27
draft: false
---

This is first post!
```

If you go back to your site in the browser you may see the post you created but not the about-us page. This is because we have enable the menu on the theme, to do this, edit the `config.toml` again and add the following parameter:

```
SectionPagesMenu = "main"
```

Save, and it should automatically reload and show About Me in the top right corner of the site.

So far you site should look something similar to this:![hugo_aboutMe.png](hugo_aboutMe.png?fileId=322829#mimetype=image%2Fpng&hasPreview=true)

Hugo is very flexible and has many options you can use to customize your pages, remember that for formatting text you can use all the feature of [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/), you can also add [feature images](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke#change-the-hero-background) or embed extra images to your post and pages.

If you want to add an image to your post or pages place the image inside the `static` folder and then use the following syntax in the page or post:

```
![Chocolate cake](/cake.jpg "A delicious chocolate cake")
```

Continue iterating on this step, by adding more posts, pages and the content you want for your site.

Once you are happy with this continue to the next section.

## To the Moon ðŸš€

So far we have been making modifications and viewing it locally, but you maybe thinking, how can my site go from being in my computer to be publicly available on the internet?

There are a couple of steps you need to follow in order to archive this and we will be detailing those in the next sections

### Hosting the site on GitHub

As we mention at the beginning of the tutorial we will be using GitHub as hosting platform for our site, GitHub's main feature is hosting code but they also have a service called GitHub pages that allows you to do what you are imagining, hosting your static site, and it the best part, it is 100% free, you do not need to deal with hosting providers, virtual servers, back-end configurations, etc.

If you want to know more about GitHub pages, watch this video:\
<<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MsN8gpT6jY>>

### Create a GitHub account

In order to host your site on GitHub, you will need an account, you can create one for free here:\
<https://github.com/join>

### Create a repository

GitHub pages are linked to GitHub repositories, in short, the code that you put in a repository can become available as a GitHub page.

First we need to create a repository, this can be called `personal-site`.

Now that we have our new code repository we need to send the code from our computer to GitHub, to Git way to upload code is using the command "git push", but just before that we need to dome some steps.

First, we need to some how, tell our code in our computer that it is a git repository linked to GitHub, to do this we run:

`git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repository-name>`

### Push your code to GitHub

Now that it knows where is the "git server" we need to tell which code we want to push, this action is called "git commit", for this time, we will make a big commit with all these new code, but normally you do small pieces describing the things that were changed.

Open GitHub Desktop and select the all the files files and create a new commit, write a commit message and click the ***commit*** *button.*

Once that we have all the code committed, we just need to push to GitHub by clicking the sync button:

This instruction is telling Git to push all committed code in the current branch to the branch `main` in `origin` if you look at the first command we set GitHub as the origin for our code repository, therefore this code will be uploaded to out GitHub repository.

Amazing! you just created your first commit ever!

Now you code is on GitHub, and at this point you could invite a friend to start collaborating in this same code and he will be able to download and push changes, reviews or comments on those modifications and improve the site together.

### Configure GitHub Actions

So far we relied on running Hugo locally to build the site locally and we pushed the source code to GitHub, but this is not the final site, we need to tell Hugo to build or package the final files that are going to be "served" to the visitors of our site. For this we will be using GitHub Actions.

GitHub Actions are basically small programs that can do things for us. Do not worry we wont need to write our own program for this. Again, we will be relying on the power of the Open Source and we will be reusing something that someone else have done and put it out for other people to use.

In this section we will be configuring a GitHub Action that will build / package our site automatically each time we merge some code into the `main` branch.

First, in your computer add 2 new folders in the root of your project: `.github` (not the dot at the begining) and inside another called `workflows` inside this folder create a file named \`gh-pages.yml\` and add the following content:

```
name: github pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Set a branch to deploy

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          submodules: true  # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive)
          fetch-depth: 0    # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod

      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
        with:
          hugo-version: 'latest'
          # extended: true

      - name: Build
        run: hugo --minify

      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./public
```

Commit this new file using GitHub Desktop and push it to GitHub.

Now if everything went well you should be able to navigate to the Actions section in your GitHub project and see it if it succeed (look for a green check).

![swappy-20210328_112840.png](swappy-20210328_112840.png?fileId=322982#mimetype=image%2Fpng&hasPreview=true)

This now means that every time you make a change to your site and push that change to the `main` brach, GitHub will create the latest version of your site automatically and save it into a branch called `gh-pages`

### Configure GitHub pages

Ok, now we have a GitHub Action that pushes our final site to the `gh-pages` branch, how can we visit our site on the internet? Here is where GitHub pages enters.

We need to tell GitHub that our repository wants to make use of GitHub pages. To do this navigate to the repository settings and scroll to the bottom of the page to the GitHub Page settings. Here you will select the `gh-pages` branch and \`/ (root)\`, click the Save button.

![swappy-20210328_113512.png](swappy-20210328_113512.png?fileId=323000#mimetype=image%2Fpng&hasPreview=true)

After saving the button the message in the green box will give the url for your new site.

Perfect! now you site is ready, and you should be able to visit it from anywhere in the world using an address like: **http://*username*.github.io/*repository***.

And there you go!, now you site can be automatically published every time that is a change, hands free! Isn't this amazing?

## Adding a custom domain

We are basically done with the guide for publishing a site for free on GitHub, but the cherry on top would be to have our own custom domain name pointing to our new site. This will give you a more professional look and with the time, your own domain will create *authority* on the internet, see this a a type of reputation on the Internet.

### Getting a free or paid domain

There a couple of sites where you can get a free domain for 1 year, some of this domains have not very common TLD's like `*.tk` you can use it and get something like `you-username.tk`. But if you are using this site for something serious like a personal website or business I would recommend something you like and would like to preserver for the years to come (remember that time you created that gigglybear4u@hotmail.com email years ago? ðŸ¤£ )

We recommend [Freenom](https://www.freenom.com/) for getting some domains free for 1 year, you can chose from `.tk`, `.ml` `.ga`, `.cf` and `.gp` chose any of those of if you prefer, you can select one of the non free one, which cost around $15 a year.

### Freenom domain

![swappy-20210328_113914.png](swappy-20210328_113914.png?fileId=323013#mimetype=image%2Fpng&hasPreview=true)

Make sure you select 1 year free and take the time to configure the DNS for GitHub pages (`185.199.108.153`) :

![swappy-20210328_114015.png](swappy-20210328_114015.png?fileId=323012#mimetype=image%2Fpng&hasPreview=true)

### Configuring DNS

Once that you have your new shiny domain name we need to tell it what to do when a person types it in the browser bar.

DNS records are the instructions that tell services where to go when someone or something queries them. For this case we will be creating an `A` record which will point to GitHub's ip address and a `CNAME` record to forward requests to `www.yourdomain.com` to the 'naked' domain `yourdomain.com`

We already created the DNS records on the previous step, so there nothing else to do on the Freenome site but we still need to tell GitHub which domain we are using.

Firstly, we need to configure our site to use that domain, we need to do 2 things.

Create a CNAME file with the domain name inside the `static` folder. You can use this single line command to do it in one go. Remember that this command needs to be executed at the root of your project using PowerShell.

```
echo "<your-domain-name>" > static/CNAME
```

Next, edit again the `config.toml` and update the first line where the baseUrl is set, now it should be your domain name: \`baseUrl = "http://<your-domain-name>"

Commit this changes and push them to GitHub.

Finally we only need to go to the repository settings on GitHub and set the domain name to ours:

![swappy-20210328_120412.png](swappy-20210328_120412.png?fileId=323036#mimetype=image%2Fpng&hasPreview=true)

If desired (and recommended) after 24 hours of enabling this option, you could enable https for you domain by checking the "Enforce HTTPS" option and updating again the baseUrl in the config.toml to be `https` instead of `http`.

## Conclusion

I hope you have enjoyed this tutorial and you are now a happy owner of a personal site on the World Wide Web. At this point in time of always connected and internet of things, having a simple website seems like not very important thing to do, since now everybody is using public services like Facebook to host their business pages. Do not let this fool you, the internet was thought as a place for freedom of speech, access to information

```

- Importance of Open Web / why is bad to use facebook for host your page
- Your have a site running for free on github, and you dont have to care about servers
